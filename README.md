# 👋 Hi, I’m @David-wacholder  

- 👀 I’m interested in code, scripts, and automations that make life a little easier and smarter.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the ropes of programming—just getting started but loving the journey!  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small, manageable projects that will help me grow and sharpen my skills.  
- 📫 How to reach me: Email is the way to go—quick and easy!  
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him... but "Master of Beginner's Luck" also works.  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can automate things faster than I can decide what to automate next!
